# venvsync

A tool to synchronize a loaded Python virtual environment 
with the local virtual environment managed by Mason for Neovim,
because I cannot wrap my head around the configurations.

# Installation

Works anywhere as long as you have Bash. Does not rely on relative
paths, as it uses environment variables for resource resolution.
